        <h2 class="center">Our History</h2>

        <p>In 1892, the City of Norfolk purchased the land that this Zoo is currently on.<br/>
        In 1900, it started becoming a zoo through purchasing 200+ animals.<br/>
        In 1974, we separated from the city park and renovated a lot of our exhibits.<br/>
        In 1992, we renovated a lot of our exhibits and got a lot of new parts!<br/></p>
